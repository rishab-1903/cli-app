# Async HTTP Request CLI

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) Python application that makes asynchronous HTTP requests to one or more URLs and displays the status, content length, and any errors encountered during the request.

## Features
- Asynchronously fetch multiple URLs concurrently using `aiohttp` and `asyncio`.
- Display the HTTP status code and content length for each URL.
- Handle request failures gracefully and provide error messages.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `aiohttp` library

## Installation

To get started, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cli_app.git
   cd cli_app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If you haven't already installed `aiohttp`, use the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install aiohttp
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   You can run the CLI app by providing one or more URLs:
   ```bash
   python cli_app.py https://example.com https://httpbin.org/get
   ```

   The app will fetch the provided URLs and print the status and content length.

## Example Output

The following example shows the output when running the CLI application with the URLs `https://example.com` and `https://httpbin.org/get`:

```bash
URL: https://example.com | Status: 200 | Content Length: 1256
URL: https://httpbin.org/get | Status: 200 | Content Length: 1024
```

In case of a failed request, the output may look like this:

```bash
Failed to fetch https://invalid-url.com: Invalid URL 'https://invalid-url.com': No schema supplied. Perhaps you meant http://https://invalid-url.com?
```

The output shows:
- The URL that was requested.
- The HTTP status code returned by the server (200 for successful responses).
- The content length (in bytes) of the response body.
- Any error encountered while fetching a URL (e.g., invalid URL, connection issues).

## Code Overview

- **`fetch_url`**: An asynchronous function that fetches a URL and prints the HTTP status code and content length.
- **`main`**: The main function that accepts a list of URLs, creates an `aiohttp` session, and asynchronously fetches the URLs concurrently using `asyncio.gather`.
- **`argparse`**: Used for accepting multiple URLs as command-line arguments.
